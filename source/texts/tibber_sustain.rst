Description
==============================================
Automate sustainability reporting. Companies manually reporting
number of flights taken, how often they bike to work, etc. is
prone to be subjective and thereby imprecise. In this project,
data is to be collected automatically for an objective report on the
companies sustainability.

By collecting data, like the companies flight records, the
persons Strava commutes, or what have you, such reporting can be automated to
classify a company on a scale of sustainability, objectively.

This sets high demands on handling privacy and the technical
magic of collecting and analyzing data.
