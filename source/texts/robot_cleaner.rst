Description
==============================================
The end result of this project is to let a robot move
in an optimal pattern around the lab with the purpose of cleaning
the floor.

Using the Turtlebot Burger and its LIDAR to map the lab,
plan an optimal route for cleaning, and finally travel that
route.
