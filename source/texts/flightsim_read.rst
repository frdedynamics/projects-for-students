Description
==============================================
Reodorklubben at Hellenes has a flight simulator that includes
an actual aircraft body.

The body is mounted on a 6 DOF Stewart platform that moves to
simulate the feel of flying an aircraft.

The motion platform is actuated by 6 linear actuators, which are
accessible over CAN bus.

The goal of this project is to collect and present data from the platform
actuators. This includes, as a minimum, position and effort of the actuators.

Further projects to follow, with a final goal of: controlling the actuators
from desired aircraft motion.
