Description
==============================================
The end result of this project is to let a robot move
from place to place autonomously at the lab.

Using the Turtlebot Burger and its LIDAR to simultanously
locate and map (SLAM) the lab. Identify specific locations,
e.g. using QR codes, and let the user send the robot to these
locations.
