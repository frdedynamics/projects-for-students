Description
==============================================
John Magne Oppedal (farmer and Hellenes AS employee) made a studding machine
for his bachelor thesis at HVL back in 2010 ish. It still works great!
Now they would like to redo the thing and invite students to go nuts on it.
Funding, guidance and help sorted. Software and mechanical. Vision and
robotics also interesting.
