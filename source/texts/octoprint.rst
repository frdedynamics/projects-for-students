Description
==============================================
The lab has two Creality Ender 3D printers. These can
be upgraded using a raspberry pi, camera and software
from OctoPrint.

The goal of this project is to allow prints to
be monitored from an app and allow stopping the
print.

Finally, write a report discussing open source
hardware and software, which this is a prime
example of.
