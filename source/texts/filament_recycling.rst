Description
==============================================
We print 3d modules and we do not always get perfect results. Instead of throwing away the wrong part, it is better to reuse it. This is environmentally friendly, and it saves costs. To recycle filament, we can melt it using an extruder and make new filament with the desired diameter. 

One way to do this project is to collect all the faulty parts that we have, then crush or divide the parts into small pieces (e.g. using a plastic shredding machines). Then we can use an extruder to melt these small parts. It is important to collect parts from the same material type. When the material melts in the extruder, it is important to keep the flow rate constant so that we get the diameter that we want. We now have new filament that can be used again.
